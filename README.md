# Geometric-control-of-Myosin-II-orientation-during-axis-elongation
Image processing code for the paper "Geometric control of Myosin-II orientation during axis elongation" by Lefebvre et al.

Contains code for the three key image processing steps for the paper, (1) computing tissue flow fields via PIV,
(2) normalizing junctional myosin with reference to cytosolic fluorescence levels, and (3) computing myosin anisotropy strength and orientation via
a windowed Radon transform.
